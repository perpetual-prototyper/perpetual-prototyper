# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt, the @perpetual-prototyper!

I love to make games! ... or rather, if I'm being honest, I love the idea of making games.

I have been toying with game development since I got my first real computer back in the 90's. 
Countless times I have geared up, buckled down, and started on a fantastic journey to create my opus. 
It usually goes really well for a time, but once I complete the core mechanics I tend to lose interest, 
put it aside, and wait for inspiration for a new opus to strike. The cycle continues.

Enter The Perpetual Prototyper. I've decided to embrace my non-commitment to finishing personal game 
projects and start a Youtube channel and these code repositories. 

I make videos of myself figuring out how to replicate game mechanics, experiment with game engine features, play with fun ideas,
or just mess around with artwork and code. This is where all of the experiments live for others to play with and learn from ... or more likely, 
learn from my mistakes. Nothing here is meant to be a complete project, a best practice, or even a good idea.. it's all meant to be used by you to experiment with and expand upon.

These are experiments, and you're free to use them however you see fit.
The license in each project overules everything, but generally the only exceptions are:
- You should not redistribute them as if they are your creation. I.E.:
   - Reposting this code somewhere and saying "Look at this thing I made!" == BAD
   - Using it as a launching point or as a piece of something larger you're building and (optionally) giving me a little shout out for the lift == Using it as intended :)
- If you re-use any of the artwork, sounds, or other assets that I've created myself pleasw give me a credit in your project. Either that modify them enough that you can say they're yours. Also, let me know, I'd love to see it!
- If you re-use any assets that are not of my creation (sources are listed in the readme of each project), then it's up to you to be sure you're compliant with the original creator's license.
