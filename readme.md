# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt, the @perpetual-prototyper!

I love to make games! ... or rather, if I'm being honest, I love the idea of making games.

I have been toying with game development since I got my first real computer back in the 90's. 
Countless times I have geared up, buckled down, and started on a fantastic journey to create my opus. 
It usually goes really well for a time, but once I complete the core mechanics and get the idea I was obsessed with out of my head I tend to lose interest, 
set it aside, and await inspiration for a new grand idea to strike. The cycle continues.

Hence my new nom de plume, "The Perpetual Prototyper". I've decided to embrace my non-commitment to finishing personal game 
projects and start a Youtube channel and these code repositories to celebrate the joy of perpetual prototyping.

I make videos of myself figuring out how to replicate game mechanics, experiment with game engine features, play with fun ideas,
and just mess around with artwork and code. This is where all of the experiments live for others to play with and learn from ... or more likely, 
learn from my mistakes. Nothing here is meant to be a complete project, a best practice, or even a good idea.. it's all meant to be used by you to play with, improve, and expand upon.

These are experiments, and for the most part you're free to use them however you see fit.

The license in each project might differ and you should be cool and follow those, but in general I would appreciate if you would be so kind as to :

- You should not redistribute this stuff as if it is your own creation. I.E.:
   - Reposting the code or assets somewhere and saying "Look at this thing I made!" is not being very cool.
   - Using it as a launching point or as a piece of something larger you're building and giving me a little shout out for the lift (optional, but appreciated) is using it as intended :)
- If you re-use any of the artwork, sounds, or other assets that I've created please give me a credit in your project. Feel free to modify them till your heart's content, and if it's changed so much that it's no longer identifiable as the thing I made, then I suppose nobody would notice. Either way, let me know where I can find your project - I'd love to see it!
- If you re-use any assets that are not of my creation (sources are listed in the readme of each project), then it's up to you to be sure you're compliant with the original creator's license.
- Don't sell my crappy art as NFT's. If I haven't figured out how to make money on that stuff I sure as heckfire don't want to see my images out there lining someone else's digital wallets with redonculous amounts of ethereal bit dollars!
